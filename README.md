# 2024-sa36-arcore || DEMO APP: CoreShow

CoreShow is a demo app that encompasses three concepts of ARCore and SceneView:

-   Placing virtual elements
-   Augmented images
-   Object Detection with ML Kit

The seminar paper describes and explores the concepts of ARCore and compares them with SceneView, an extension of ARCore.

## Setup

It's best to briefly test the app before reading to visually understand what the paper will discuss. The app doesn't require specific installation. ARCore installs automatically when the app starts, and no settings are needed in Android Studio. 

## Note!

Unfortunately, it's not possible to test an AR app on the emulator. A physical Android phone is necessary.

# Demo Images and Videos

Since the app only works on Android, the Demo-Media folder contains various images and videos of the app.

## Links and References

Links and references are located in the footer of the seminar paper.
